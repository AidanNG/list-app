# To Do List App
This is a basic list app. It's simple but I wanted a project that I could scale and apply alot of the knowledge that I have picked up over the years.

I make a lot of lists in Google docs in order to stay on track with the things I want to get done. Being what it is, it has a lot of limitations.
This project will hopefully solve that problem for me. Any feedback and advice on how to expand is greatly appreciated.

To get started, Run the init.py to create the csvs and install packages,

python init.py

and then from there, to use the app,

python main.py
